            We at SBOA believe that science lab equipments allow students to
            interact directly with the data gathered. They get first hand
            learning experience by performing various experiments on their own.
            School science lab equipments make teaching and learning easy and
            interesting for the students.The lab experiences enhance mastery of
            science , develop scientific reasoning abilities, increasing
            understanding of the complexity and ambiguity of empirical work.{" "}

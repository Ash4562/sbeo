            First step in this direction was installation of Tata Class edgeÂ 
            technology in the year 2017-18 . At present we haveÂ Â  Tata Class
            edge outlet installed in 21 classrooms. This has rendered both
            Teaching and learning more meaningful and interesting. Its multiple
            learning experience model is developed on premise that when students
            use multiple senses and are involved in variety of plan activities.
            They will be better involved in learning process and will retain the
            concepts better

            Next step in digitization SBOA Public School started using a web
            based software named DIVINE CAMPUS for school management in the year
            2018-19. It provides the facilities like¬† Attendance of students &
            teachers, certificates and Documents, fee & finance, HR & Payroll
            inventory & purchase, transportation management etc. Migration to
            the Divine Campus platform has ensured effective control over
            attendance & fee, circulars, Homework etc. This has also reduced a
            lot of duplication of the work, where by Teachers can devote more
            time towards the academics.
